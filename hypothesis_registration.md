1, Common binary classification algorithms can achieve
high accuracy in leukemia cancer classification problems.
There is no need to create or invent an algorithm from scratch.  

2, The original classifier selected 50 features (too many).
Whether using Golub’s original classifier or other common
binary classification algorithms, one may use fewer features
(such as 10, or 6 features) to achieve similar model performances.  
  
3, The most “informative” genes selected by Golub’s method, 
may not be the same as the important features selected by common binary classification algorithms, 
for example, the list of feature importance with random forest algorithms.
